    Hi! I'm Zac Garby, a <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psyzg5/">PhD student</a> in the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/fp-lab/">FP lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk">The University of Nottingham</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I'm really interested in programming languages (mostly <a href="https://www.haskell.org">functional</a> <a href="https://github.com/zac-garby/diss/tree/master/fugue">ones</a>) and how they can be made easier to use (e.g. interactive programming, clever type systems), plus things like program synthesis, holes, and anything else to do with incomplete programs. For my 4th year dissertation, I came up with some novel techniques for synthesising recursive functions (have a look at <a href="/files/paper.pdf">my paper</a> - it should be readable without any background in the area!) and implemented them in my toy programming language, <a href="https://github.com/zac-garby/diss/tree/master/fugue">Fugue</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Most of my old projects are completely unfinished, but feel free to have a look around my <a href="https://github.com/zac-garby">GitHub</a> page nevertheless. There's some cool stuff there! Also, I've written up all of the <a href="/hackathons">hackathon projects</a> I've done over the years.
